# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction Research

### Techniques Employed
Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Machine Learning models

### Context
The main objective of this project is to understand the contentment of airline passengers which impacts the business performance and its future profitability. Multiple models were experimented using different models with the help of data analytics and machine learning techniques to categorize the customers into satisfactory and dissatisfactory groups. 

### Datasets
Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) was used for the data analysis and designing a model for this business case. Dataset contains two segments of information, one is the nature of airline customers which consists of the customer id with which a customer is identified and their personal information like age, gender. Etc. the second segment of dataset contains the information on satisfaction level (rating 0-5) of the customers on the services provided by the airlines such as inflight Wi-Fi service, food and drinks service. Etc. Dataset includes around ~125000 rows(customers) data. 
Dataset consists of 56% of satisfied customers & 44% of dissatisfied customers. This huge data available to us along with the target variable being binary and close to balanced ratio, enables us to ignore using the resampling techniques.
